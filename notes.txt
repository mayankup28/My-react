SOME RULE OF IMPORT EXPORT IN REACT

if we export any component as default like (export default app) then we can import this component with any name

example->export default app

         import anyname from './app'


         but if we have multiple function in a single component like app1,app2,app3
         then we can export like this...export{app1,app2,app3} and when we want import these file. we have to use the same name like export.we can not change the name of exports functions.

         example-> import {app1,app2,app3} from './app'

         or we can do also import{app1 as anyname,app2,app3} from'./app'
         if we use as with anyname then app1 name will chnaged as anyname


         SOME RULE OF PROPS

         we can send string as props without any curly bracket like this
         
         New way-> <app1 name="mayank"/>

         Old way-> <app1 name={"mayank"}/>


         we can receive props like this also (destructring) ..

         example->
          <app1 name="mayank" text="eng"/>


function Myheading(props) {
    const{name,text}=props
    return (
        <div>
            <h2>{name}</h2>
            <h2>{text}</h2>
            </div>
    )
}


               OR


   function Myheading({name,text}) {
      return (
              <div>
            <h2>{name}</h2>
            <h2>{text}</h2>
            </div>
    )
}


if we dont have any props value. then we can do like this

 <app1 name="mayank" />

function Myheading({name,text="eng"}) {
    
    return (
        <div>
            Myheading

            <h2>{name}</h2>
            <h2>{text}</h2>
            </div>
    )
}




Diffrence between npm and npx 

npm install react globaly so when we need to install react we dont need to write every time (npm) all we have to type only create-react-app and ap name

example- npm -g create-react-app [appname](installing react globaly)

and next time we have to just type create-react-app  mayapp


npx will install react for single time when we need new react app we have to write npx create-react-app [myapp] 



Time=> 4.39
